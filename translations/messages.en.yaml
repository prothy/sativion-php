    - title: "Sustainability"
      desc: "We care, because it affects all of us. The cultivation of industrial hemp, which is the basis of a countless number of products is sustainable, because it absorbs a lot of CO2 as it grows, and almost the whole plant can be used. With this in mind, we have chosen hemp as the central raw material for our business."
    - title: "Customer focus"
      desc: "We pay special attention to meet the needs of our suppliers and customers, both professionally and humanly. We are interested in long-term cooperation with all our partners and we believe in the importance of sharing our knowledge. We always finish what we started, and we always fulfill our contractual obligations."
    - title: "Development"
      desc: "It is not enough to just campaign for it, we need to move forward on our designated path to make development a process. We are constantly evolving, so we can better serve our corporate and private customers. This also induces the development of our partners and suppliers, as this is the only way we can all be successful."
    - title: "Courage"
      desc: "We are fighting to change the negative associations regarding hemp. We stand for this great plant because we know we are doing something good for people and for the environment. We are bold in developing and creating new products and we want to pass this attitude on to our partners and customers."
food:
  title: "Food"
  text: "The nutritional and biological value of foods made from hemp is extremely high. This is due to their polyunsaturated fatty acid content, especially the perfect ratio of omega 6 to omega 3 fatty acids (3: 1). In addition, the presence of all 9 essential amino acids makes hemp foods an essential part of a healthy diet."
health:
  title: "Health"
  text: "The best known of the hundreds of cannabionides found in hemp are THC, CBD, CBG, and CBC. The latter three compounds, unlike THC, are not psychoactive, however, their other beneficial effects on the human body have been proven by numerous studies. Cannabis can help with many conditions, such as reducing the symptoms of epilepsy, alleviating mental disorders, treating Alzheimer's disease, asthma, cancer, and relieving menstrual cramps."
